Climate forecast/ Climate prediction,"A climate prediction or climate forecast is the result of an attempt to produce an estimate of the actual evolution of the climate in the future, for example, at seasonal, interannual or decadal time scales. Because the future evolution of the climate system may be highly sensitive to initial conditions, has chaotic elements and is subject to natural variability, such predictions are usually probabilistic in nature.",气候预报/气候预测,气候预测或气候预报是尝试对未来气候的实际演变进行预估的结果，例如以季节、年际或十年为时间尺度。由于未来气候系统的演化可能对初始条件高度敏感，且具有混浊元素并且受到自然变化的影响，因此这种预测通常具有概率性。,
Likely/ unlikely,The probability of an occurrence is greater than 66% / the probability of an occurrence is less than 33% ,可能/ 不大可能,发生的可能性 66-100% 概率 / 0-33% 概率 ,"The translation of 'unlikely' will depend on the context.
